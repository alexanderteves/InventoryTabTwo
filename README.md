# InventoryTabTwo

This is a fork of [SirKota's RimWorld mod "InventoryTab"](https://github.com/SirKota/InventoryTab).

Initially forked to update the mod to work with RimWorld v1.5, I will continue development on my own to learn and improve.

This mod adds an overview of all items in your colony's stockpiles, optionally including pawns, corpses and the whole map.

## Building

Install [.NET for your platform](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download). You do not need to install the .NET Framework 4.7.2 or RimWorld since reference assemblies for both are used.

```
$> dotnet build InventoryTabTwo.csproj
```

## Installation

This fork will not be published in the game's workshop on Steam. Instead, you can package a `*.tar.gz` file and [extract it in the game's "Mods" directory](https://rimworld.fandom.com/wiki/Mods).

Packages can also be found under "Releases".
